This branch is the smallest example of what I found in my main project. See error-1 + working-example-1 or error-2 + working-example-2 to identifty the behavior around `use server`.

Example pr's to fix the errors:

1. PR for error 1 [link](https://github.com/ryan-callahan-edo/nitro-app-undefined-repro/pull/2)
2. PR for error 2 [link](https://github.com/ryan-callahan-edo/nitro-app-undefined-repro/pull/1)
